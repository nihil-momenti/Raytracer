  The final ray tracer is available at \url{http://github.com/Nemo157/Raytracer}.

  Figure \ref{example} below shows a low quality ten minute render.  As can be
  seen from this image ten minutes isn't long enough to get a very good image.
  The render time is very dependent on image complexity as well as quality, Fig.
  \ref{example2} below was rendered at a similar quality level with slightly
  more anti-aliasing but because of the increased complexity took 4.5X as long.
  As an example of the sort of quality it is possible to get see Figures
  \ref{good-render},\ref{good-render2}, these however took much much longer to
  generate.  This would be OK if you are just trying to get a static high
  quality image.
