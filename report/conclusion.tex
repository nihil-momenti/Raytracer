\section{Conclusions}
  The biggest flaw in the final renderer is its performance.  This could largely
  be mitigated by moving to a lower level language; or at least implementing the
  majority of the renderer in a low level language, e.g. writing a C extension
  for the low level geometry methods.

  An even more drastic performance improvement could be found by implementing
  the low level functions in OpenCL.  This was contemplated early on in the
  project but discarded because of the large amount of work that would be
  required.
